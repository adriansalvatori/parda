# parda
'Parda' is a react frontend boilerplate based in Parcel. 
Really young, only tested in a couple exercises. 

##Why Parda

Until now, i've been using webpack but it has become incredibly slow for some reason I don't really have time to dig into. 
Parcel is just faster and easier, and requires almost no configuration. 

##How to start Parda
Easy. It has only two commands out of the box: 
<pre>yarn start | npm run start</pre>
...to start watching files. You can access the project at localhost:1234

<pre>yarn production | npm run production</pre>
...to build production files. You can access the final output at the /dist folder.
